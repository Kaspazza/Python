Your role is to save hangman's life by guessing the name of capital.

The letters of a password to guess are marked with #.
Every # responds to the letter of capital.
If there is space between "#" symbols, then the capital's name consists more than one word.

You can try to guess a single letter or the whole name.

At the beginning of the game, You have 0 points. 
If You do not guess the letter you will gain 1 penalty point. 
If You do not guess the whole password, You gain 2 penalty points. 

Gaining 5 points or more is equivalent to Hangman's death.

When You win, check if You have not broken the record! 

Have fun!  ~ Krzysiek and Mateusz.
